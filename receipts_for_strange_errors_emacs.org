* Introduction

These are notes of fixing strange errors of emacs:

* Error of "pdf-info-check-epdfinfo: pdf-info-epdfinfo-program is not executable"

Sometimes, when performing tangle code block in org-mode, this error may appear, causing
failure to tangle.

It turned out that it's caused by PDF-tools has not yet been installed, after a new Doom/emacs installation or significant upgrade.
Performing M-x pdf-tools-install then the subsequent tangle operation will succeed.

It's not obvious how the PDF-tools is related code tangle, but it's indeed.
